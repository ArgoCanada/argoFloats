**Abstract**
Argo floats data undergo a series of testing procedures to assess the quality.
In addition, some data sets undergo adjustments that are made in recognition of
the Quality Control (QC) analysis or to employ information about improved
calibrations, etc. The creators of `argoFloats` therefore developed a way to
deal with QC flags and adjusted data. For quality control, this centers around
three functions: `plot(which='QC')`, `showQCTests()`and `applyQC()`. Adjusted
data are handled with the `useAdjusted()` function.

# How QC Flags are set

Core, biogeochemical (BGC), and Deep Argo data all undergo testing to ensure the
data found at the Data Assembly Centers are as accurate as possible. This is
done on both "real time" data and "delayed mode" data. As explained in the Argo
User's Manual (Carval et al. 2019), real time measurements are assigned a QC
flag within a 24-48 hour time frame, and delayed mode are looked at by
scientists who apply procedures to check the quality.

# Flags

As described by the Argo user's manual (Carval et al. 2019), data that are given
a flag value of 1, 2, 5, or 8 are considered 'good' data. If data are given a
flag value of 9 (or missing value) they are not used, and flags 3, 5, 6, and 7
are considered 'bad' data.

`argoFloats` has taken this idea, and has incorporated a 3 step process when
considering the QC of Argo flags. The three step process encourages
users to always analyze the data they are considering, and acknowledges that the
user assumes all risk from their Argo data, as described in section 1.3 of the
Argo User's Manual (Carval et al. 2019). The three step process is shown in the following diagram.

![Figure 1: argoFloats Quality Control Flag Process](qc_flowchart.png)

This vignette will walk the users through the three step flag process using the float with `id` 1901584 near the Bahamas.

### Step One: QC Plot

Our `argoFloats` package uses the flags of profiles to determine "good" and
"bad" data. We then created a plot type to demonstrate the quality of data, the
`QC` plot. The `QC` plot plots parameter quality and parameter mean. This
only works if `x` is an object that was created by `getProfiles()`. The user
must also provide the `parameter` of interest. If the user is uncertain about
what parameter exists within a certain float, `argoFloats` will prompt the user
with the appropriate parameters.

An example of how to get the `QC` plot for temperature for the float with `id` 1901584 is as follows:

```{r, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(argoFloats)
data("index")
subset <- subset(index, id='1901584')
profiles <- getProfiles(subset)
argos <- readProfiles(profiles)
plot(argos, which='QC', parameter='temperature')
```

![Figure 2: QC plot for temperature recorded by the float with `id` 1901584](plotqc.png)


**Exercise One:** Use the previous code to determine the QC of temperature for
float number 4900845 in synthetic data using `plot(..., which='QC')`. Explain your results.

### Step Two: showQCTests()

`showQCTests` print a summary of the QC tests (if any) that were
performed on an Argo profile. It uses `hexToBits()` to decode the hexadecimal
values that may be stored in `historyQCTest` and `historyAction` within the metadata
slot of an individual Argo profile, as read directly with `oce::read.argo()` or
indirectly with `readProfiles()`.

Using the same example as shown in `plot(..., which='QC')`, we can also determine
which QC tests were performed on each profile. This is completed by
`showQCTests()` in the following code:

```{r, message=FALSE, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(argoFloats)
data('index')
s <- subset(index, id='1901584')
subset <- subset(s, cycle='124') 
profiles <- getProfiles(subset)
argos <- readProfiles(profiles)
argos1 <- argos[[1]]
showQCTests(argos[[1]])
```

In section 3.11 Reference table 11: QC test binary ids of the Argo User's Manual
(Carval et al. 2019), we see that test 14 was failed: ie. the Density Inversion Test.

**Exercise Two**: Use the first float with `id` 4900845 in exercise one to determine
which tests were performed and/or failed during quality control testing. Explain your results.

### Step Three: applyQC()

The `applyQC()` function examines QC within an `argoFloats` object that was
created by `readProfiles()`. By default, it replaces all suspicious data with NA
values, so they will not appear in plots or be considered in calculations. This
is an important early step in processing, because suspicious Argo floats
commonly report data that are suspicious based on statistical and physical
measures.

Using the same example as shown in `plot(...,which='QC')` and `showQCTests()`, the
user also has the ability to use `applyQC()` as shown below:

```{r, message=FALSE, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(argoFloats)
# Contrast TS diagrams for raw and flag-handled data
data(index)
i <- subset(index, id='1901584')
raw <- readProfiles(getProfiles(i))
clean <- applyQC(raw)
par(mfrow=c(1, 2))
plot(raw, which="TS")
plot(clean, which="TS")
```

![Figure 3: argoFloats applyQC() function used on float with `id` 1901584](applyQC.png)


**Exercise Three** : Use `applyQC()` on float `id` with 4900845. Explain your results.

**NOTE:** Although, the `applyQC` function removes the "bad" data for the user, if they wish to analyze the data themselves, one easy way using basic R functions is as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(argoFloats)
data(index)
i <- subset(index, id='1901584')
raw <- readProfiles(getProfiles(i))
clean <- applyQC(raw)
A <- raw[[1]]
D <- data.frame(T = A[['temperature']], TF=A[['temperatureFlag']], S=A[['salinity']], SF=A[['salinityFlag']], P=A[['pressure']], PF=A[['pressureFlag']])
head(D)
```
# Adjusted Data

### useAdjusted()

In addition to flags marking bad data based on tests, `argoFloats` package has also incorporated the idea of `<param>Adjusted` which considers "bad" data that has been adjusted (Carval et al. 2019).

This is done by using `oce::preferAdjusted()` on each of the Argo objects stored
within the first argument. The procedure is fairly complicated, so users are
urged to read the documentation for `oce::preferAdjusted()` after reading the
sketch provided in the “Details” section of `?useAdjusted()` and familiarizing themselves with the flow chart below that demonstrates the steps taken when a user specifies `which=ALL` or `which=<param>`.

![Figure 4: Flow chat for useAdjusted() function within argoFloats package when which argument is equal to ALL or param](../man/figures/useAdjustedDiagram.png)

An example of the significance of adjusted data can be shown below:

```{r, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(argoFloats)
raw <- readProfiles(system.file("extdata", "SD5903586_001.nc", package="argoFloats"))
adj <- useAdjusted(raw)
par(mfrow=c(1,2), mar=c(5,4,1,2))
hist(raw[[1]][['oxygen']], xlab='Raw Oxygen', ylab="Frequency", main=NULL)
hist(adj[[1]][['oxygen']], xlab='Adjusted Oxygen', ylab="Frequency", main=NULL)
summary(unlist(raw[['oxygen']]))
summary(unlist(adj[['oxygen']]))
```

![Figure 5: argoFloats useAdjusted() function used on float with `id` 1901584](useAdjusted.png)


**Exercise Four** Use `useAdjusted()` on the float with `id` 5903586, cycle=50 to
compare `<param>adjusted`

# Answers

*Exercise One:* Use the previous code to determine the QC of temperature for
float number 4900845 in synthetic data using `plot(...,which='QC')`. Explain your results.
```
library(argoFloats)
ais <- getIndex(filename = 'synthetic', age=0)
sub <- subset(ais, id='4900845')
profiles <- getProfiles(sub)
argos <- readProfiles(profiles)
plot(argos, which='QC', parameter='temperature')
```
As shown in the plot, 100% of the temperature data is considered "good". This
implies to the user that all data is considered okay to use.

*Exercise Two*: Use the first float with `id` 4900845 in exercise one to determine
which tests were performed and/or failed during quality control testing. Explain your results.

```
library(argoFloats)
data('indexSynthetic')
sub <- subset(indexSynthetic, id='4900845')
profiles <- getProfiles(sub)
argos <- readProfiles(profiles)
a1 <- argos[[1]]
showQCTests(a1)
```
As shown by the `showQCTests()` function, no quality control tests were actually
performed on this float id. This is a case where the user would have to self
analyze their data to ensure all data seems reasonable.

*Exercise Three* : Use `applyQC()` on float `id` = 4900845. Explain your results.
```
library(argoFloats)
# Contrast TS diagrams for raw and flag-handled data
data(indexSynthetic)
i <- subset(indexSynthetic, id='4900845')
raw <- readProfiles(getProfiles(i))
clean <- applyQC(raw)
par(mfrow=c(1, 2))
plot(raw, which="TS")
plot(clean, which="TS")
```
As shown by the plot, the plot containing "good" data and the plot containing
"bad" data are the same. This is the result of no tests being completed for QC, as shown by `showQCTests()`.

*Exercise Four* Use `useAdjusted()` on the float with `id` 5903586, cycle=50 to
compare `<param>adjusted`. Explain your results.

```
library(argoFloats)
bai <- getIndex('synthetic')
s <- subset(bai, id='5903586')
ss <- subset(s, 50)
profiles <- getProfiles(ss)
raw <- readProfiles(profiles)
adj <- useAdjusted(raw)
par(mfrow=c(1, 2))
oce::plotProfile(oce::as.ctd(raw[[1]]), xtype="oxygen")
mtext("Raw data", side=3, line=-1, col=2)
oce::plotProfile(oce::as.ctd(adj[[1]]), xtype="oxygen")
mtext("Adjusted data", side=3, line=-1, col=2)
summary(unlist(raw[['oxygen']]))
summary(unlist(adj[['oxygen']]))
```
As shown from `plot(..,which='QC')` and 'showQCTests()`, there has been no QC completed on this profile, and therefore no adjustments. This is a case where a use must analyze their data to determine if it is "good" data.
