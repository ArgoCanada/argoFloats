#' Use quality-control flags to alter argoFloats data
#'
#' This function examines the quality-control (QC) flags within an [argoFloats-class]
#' object that was created by [readProfiles()].  By default, it replaces all suspicious
#' data with `NA` values, so they will not appear in plots or be considered in calculations.
#' This is an important early step in processing, because suspicious argo floats commonly
#' report data that are suspicious based on statistical and physical measures, as
#' is illustrated in the \dQuote{Examples} section.
#'
#' The work is done by using [oce::handleFlags,argo-method()]
#' on each of the profiles stored within the object. In most cases, only
#' the object needs to be specified, for the default actions coincide with
#' common conventions for flags in argo data.
#'
#' @param x An [argoFloats-class] object of type `"argos"`, as created by
#' [readProfiles()].
#'
#' @param flags A vector of integers that are the quality-control flag
#' values for data that are to be set to `NA` in the returned result.
#' The default, `NULL`, means to use the flags set up by [readProfiles()]
#' which, unless specified otherwise in the call to that function, are
#' set up to regard as suspicious any data entries that are flagged
#' with QC codes of 0 (for data that have not yet been assessed),
#' 3 (for "probably bad" data),
#' 4 (for "bad" data),
#' 6 (an unused flag),
#' 7 (an unused flag), or
#' 9 (for "missing" data).  See Section 3.2.2 of Carval et al. (2019) for
#' more information on these QC code values.
#'
#' @param actions The actions to perform. The default, `NULL`, means to
#' use the actions set up by [readProfiles()], which, by default.
#' causes any data flagged as suspicious to be set to `NA`.
#'
#' @param debug Passed to [oce::handleFlags,argo-method()].
#'
#' @return A copy of `x` but with each of the objects within its
#' `data` slot having been passed through [oce::handleFlags,argo-method()].
