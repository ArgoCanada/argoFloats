# Summary

In addition to URL problems, a local `R CMD CHECK` (and the equivalent from
within RStudio) give a NOTE on installed size being 9.4Mb.  However,
`devtools::check_win_release()` does not show this NOTE.

**QUESTION.** Is the size a concern for a CRAN submission? And, if so, what
steps should we take?  (I have seen this expansion of the 'size' of R before,
and I think it has to do with importing other packages.)

# Local check within RStudio

```
> checking installed package size ... NOTE
    installed size is  9.4Mb
    sub-directories of 1Mb or more:
      R   8.0Mb

0 errors ✓ | 0 warnings ✓ | 1 note x
```
