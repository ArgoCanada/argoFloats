* `argoFloats_logo_04.R` as `argoFloats_logo_03.R` but use oce GEBCO colours
  for depth, instead of cmocean 'deep', consistent with the `plot()` default.
*  `argoFloats_logo_05.R` as `argoFloats_logo_04.R` but remove the "R" and the
   axis labels, and make graph larger, and darken the deep water a bit. Note
that the first two lines are flags to turn "R" and axes on and off.
