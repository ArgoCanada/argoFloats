This is a sandbox for dek, which means that only dek should create files and
directories here.

* `01_merged_files` holds tests of reading merged files.
* `02_workflow` makes a workflow diagram (since included in the vignette, which
  now holds an improved version)
* `03_by_ocean` show that subset by ocean is faulty, and that polygon can come
  to the rescue
* `04_wgc` a start to west-Greenland current (aborted)
* `05_hex_logo` hex log ideas
* `06_name_icon` name badge for virtual meetings
* `07_trajectory` draw trajectory of an individual float
* `08_oxygen` what explains oxygen flags?
