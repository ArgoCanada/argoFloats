This is a sandbox for dek, which means that only dek should create files and
directories here.

* `01_merged_files` holds tests of reading merged files.
* `02_workflow` makes a workflow diagram (since included in the vignette, which
  now holds an improved version)
* `03_by_ocean`
* `04_wgc`
* `05_hex_logo` hex log ideas
