**Abstract**

# Introduction to Flags
Core, biogeochemical (BGC), and Deep Argo data all undergo testing to ensure the data found at the Data Assembly Centers are as accurate as possible. More specifically, testing in done in three levels:

1: Real time that complete checks on all measurements and assigned a quality flag within a 24-48 hour timeframe
2. Delayed mode
3. The third level of quality control is regional scientific analyses of all float data with other available data. The procedures for regional analyses are still to be determined.

Using the History section of the Argo netCDF Structure".




As described by the Argo userâ€™s manual V3.3 [1], data that are given a flag value of 1, 2, 5, or 8 are considered 'good' data. If data are given a flag value of 9 (or missing value) they are not used, and flags 3, 5, 6, and 7 are considered 'bad' data. 

*Hypothesis* : Our hypothesis is that real-time data have all NAs for <PARAM>ADJUSTED, and we should therefore only use the <PARAM>ADJUSTED for delayed mode data.
