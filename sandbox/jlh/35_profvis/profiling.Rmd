# Using profiling to determine if we should use "save" or "load" for getIndex()
author: Jaimie Harbin

The `profvis` package is used to display the timing of `profiling`. This is helpful for us when deciding if we should save, or re-read every time we use `getIndex()`.

To get started, download the `profvis` package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("profvis")
library(profvis)
```

Then, go to the "Profile" tab at the top of the R session, and click "Start Profiling".

In the Console, then type `ai <- getIndex(age=0)`. When the action is complete, press Profile>Stop Profiling. The output is a Flame Graph, as shown in Figure 1.

Do the same procedure, but for `ai <- getIndex()` Note, each laptop (and different times of day) will result in different results.

You then have the ability to hold your mouse over each "box" ie. `getIndex()`, `read.csv`, `save`, `load`, etc. to display the amount of time to compute the action (shown in Figure 2)

For JH at 1230h on 2020-12-23, the following are the computation times.

**For getIndex(age=0)**
Total time for `getIndex(age=0)` was ~32 seconds. Of that, save was ~12 seconds (shown in Figure 3), and read.csv was 13.8 seconds. This means, if we were to remove the "save" portion of the action, it would take approximately 32-12=20 seconds.

**For getIndex()**
The total time for `getIndex()` was ~7 seconds, with the "load" action being 100% of that (ie. ~7 seconds, shown in Figure 4).

These results tell us that for my computation the options are are follows:

If we keep "save", we have a one time computation of ~32 seconds, with the rest of the time we use the `getIndex()` function being ~7 seconds. If we remove "save" we have our computation time EACH time being ~32-12=20 seconds.

For Dan at approximately 1030h on 2020-12-23,

**For `getIndex(age=0)`, his total computation time was 24 seconds, with approximately 10 seconds being "save".
** For `getIndex()`, his total computation time, (ie. load time) was 4 seconds.

In his case, if we keep "save", we have a one time computation of ~24 seconds, with the rest of the time we use the `getIndex()` function being ~4 seconds. If we remove "save" we have our computation time EACH time being ~24-4=20 seconds.
