\title{A Package for Processing Argo Float Profiles}
\description{
This package provides tools for downloading and processing Argo profile data.
\strong{FIXME(jlh) Please write the remainder of a paragraph here.  According to
the way Roxygen works, this paragarph will be called
'Description', and any later paragraphs (as I've started below)
will be called 'Details'. It is conventional
that the first paragraph be an overall
introduction, like an abstract.
I don't think we want a lot of
depth though, because the function documentation is the main source
that we want users to consult. Note, for example, how in the text I put
after the diagram, I used links instead of discussing what those functions do.
We could chat about what goes here, if that would help. --dek.}

The sketch given below illustrates the typical workflow with the \code{argoFloats} package, with
descriptions of the steps on the left, and names of the relevant \code{argoFloats} files
on the right.

The package vignette provides more concrete examples of the workflow, and the
documentation entries for \code{\link[=getIndex]{getIndex()}}, \code{\link[=getProfiles]{getProfiles()}}, and \code{\link[=readProfiles]{readProfiles()}}
provide details, and some examples.
