\title{A Package for Processing Argo Float Profiles}
\description{
This package provides tools for downloading and processing Argo profile data. It allows
users to focus on core argo, bgc argo, or deep argo individual profiles, and specific profiles
based on time, geography, and institution.
}
\details{
The sketch given below illustrates the typical workflow with the \code{argoFloats} package, with
descriptions of the steps on the left, and names of the relevant \code{argoFloats} files
on the right.

The package vignette provides more concrete examples of the workflow, and the
documentation entries for \code{\link[=getIndex]{getIndex()}}, \code{\link[=getProfiles]{getProfiles()}}, and \code{\link[=readProfiles]{readProfiles()}}
provide details along with some examples.

The package specializes three generic methods, as follows.
\enumerate{
\item The \code{[[} method is specialized to extract items within \code{argoFloats} objects,
as a convenient way for users to look up values of interest, without getting
into the details of storage.
See \code{\link{[[,argoFloats-method}} for details.
(Note that \verb{[[<-} is \emph{not} specialized, since the
user is highly discouraged from altering values within \code{argoFloats}
objects.)
\item The \code{subset} method is specialized to isolate profiles of interest from
a general index. See \code{\link[=subset,argoFloats-method]{subset,argoFloats-method()}} for details.
\item The \code{plot} method is specialized to provide some simple ways to plot
groups of \code{argoFloats} profiles.  See \code{\link[=plot,argoFloats-method]{plot,argoFloats-method()}} for details.
}

In addition to these and other functions provided by the \code{argoFloats} package,
the profile elements within \code{argoFloats} objects are stored as
objects of the \code{argo} defined by the \code{oce} package.  That means
that a wide variety of \code{oce} functions can be used in the analysis
of those profiles.  And, of course, the full suite of R tools is
also available; that is the whole point of writing this package in R.
