\title{A Package for Processing Argo Float Profiles}
\description{
The \code{argoFloats} package provides tools for downloading and processing Argo profile data.
It allows users to focus on core, biogeochemical ("BGC"), or deep Argo profiles, and
also to sift these profiles based on ID, time, geography, variable, institution, and ocean, etc.
Once downloaded, such datasets can be analyzed within \code{argoFloats} or using other R tools
and packages.
}
\details{
The development website is \url{https://github.com/ArgoCanada/argoFloats}, and
\url{https://argocanada.github.io/argoFloats/index.html} provides a simpler view
that may be more helpful to most users. For more on the argoFloats package, see
Kelley et al. (2021).

The sketch given below illustrates the typical workflow with the package, with
descriptions of the steps on the left, and names of the relevant functions
on the right.

\if{html}{\figure{workflow.png}{options: width=455px alt="Figure: workflow.png"}}

As illustrated, the central functions are named
\code{\link[=getIndex]{getIndex()}}, \link[=subset,argoFloats-method]{subset()},
\code{\link[=getProfiles]{getProfiles()}}, and \code{\link[=readProfiles]{readProfiles()}}, and so a good way to
get familiar with the package is to read their documentation entries
and try the examples provided therein.  Some built-in datasets are provided
for concreteness of illustration and for testing, but actual work always
starts with a call to \code{\link[=getIndex]{getIndex()}} to download a full index of float data.

In addition to these functions, \code{argoFloats} also provides
specialized versions of R "generic" functions, as follows.
\enumerate{
\item \code{[[} provides a way to extract items from \code{argoFloats} objects,
without getting lost in the details of storage.
See \code{\link{[[,argoFloats-method}} for details.
(Note that \verb{[[<-} is \emph{not} specialized, since the
user is highly discouraged from altering values within \code{argoFloats}
objects.)
\item \code{plot()} provides simple ways to plot aspects of \code{\linkS4class{argoFloats}} objects.
See \code{\link[=plot,argoFloats-method]{plot,argoFloats-method()}} for details.
\item \code{summary()} displays key features of \code{\linkS4class{argoFloats}} objects.
See \code{\link[=summary,argoFloats-method]{summary,argoFloats-method()}} for details.
\item \code{show()} provides a one-line sketch of \code{\linkS4class{argoFloats}} objects.
See \code{\link[=show,argoFloats-method]{show,argoFloats-method()}} for details.
\item \code{merge()} combines multiple index objects into a new index object.
}

It should be noted that the profile elements within \code{argoFloats} objects are stored as
in the form of \code{argo} objects as defined by the \code{oce} package.
This means that \code{argoFloats} users can rely on
a wide variety of \code{oce} functions to analyze their data.
The full suite of R tools is also available, and the vastness of
that suite explains why \code{argoFloats} is written in R.
