}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An \link[oce:argo-class]{oce::argo} object, as read directly with \code{\link[oce:read.argo]{oce::read.argo()}}
or as extracted from the return value of a call to \code{\link[=readProfiles]{readProfiles()}}, as
in the \dQuote{Examples}.}

\description{
\code{showQCTests} print a summary of the quality-control (QC) tests
(if any) that were performed on an argo profile.  It uses
\code{\link[=hexToNibble]{hexToNibble()}} to decode the hexadecimal  values that may
be stored in \code{historyQCTest} and \code{historyAction} within
the \code{metadata} slot of an individual argo profile, as read
directly with \code{\link[oce:read.argo]{oce::read.argo()}} or indirectly with
\code{\link[=readProfiles]{readProfiles()}}, the latter being illustrated in the
\dQuote{Examples} secton below.
The format used in \code{historyQCTest} and \code{historyAction}
is mentioned in Sections 2.2.7, 2.3.7, 5.1, 5.3 and 5.4
of Carval et al. (2019), in which they are called
\code{HISTORY_QC_TEST} and \code{HISTORY_ACTION}, respectively.

\examples{
library(argoFloats)
a <- readProfiles(system.file("extdata", "D4900785_048.nc", package="argoFloats"))
showQCTests(a[[1]])
