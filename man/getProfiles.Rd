\title{Get Profiles Named in an argoFloats Index}
\usage{
getProfiles(
  index,
  destdir = NULL,
  age = 365,
  retries = 3,
  skip = TRUE,
  quiet = TRUE,
  debug = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{index}{an \code{\linkS4class{argoFloats}} object of type \code{"index"}, as created
by \code{\link[=getIndex]{getIndex()}}.}

\item{destdir}{character value naming the directory into which to store the
downloaded Argo files, or \code{NULL} (the default) to use the value of
\code{destdir} that was provided in the \code{\link[=getIndex]{getIndex()}} call that created \code{index}.}

\item{age}{a numerical value indicating a time interval, in days.  If the file
to be downloaded from the server already exists locally, and was created
is less than \code{age} days in the past, it will not be downloaded.  The default
is one year.  Setting \code{age=0} will force a download.}

\item{retries}{integer telling how many times to retry a download,
if the first attempt fails.}

\item{skip}{A logical value indicating whether to skip over netcdf
files that cannot be downloaded from the server.  This is \code{FALSE} by
default, so that \code{\link[=getProfiles]{getProfiles()}} will raise an error if it is
impossible to re-download an outdated file.  This is not
unexpected with built-in index files, e.g. \code{data(index)},
because this package cannot be updated every time the Argo
servers change the names of netcdf files.  However, users
are commonly working with index files they created with
\code{\link[=getIndex]{getIndex()}}, so they ought to be up-to-date.}

\item{quiet}{logical value; use \code{TRUE} to show more
verbose information when downloading files.
(Problems will still be reported, though.)}

\item{debug}{integer value indicating level of debugging. If this
is less than 1, no debugging is done. Otherwise, some functions
will print debugging information.  If a function call fails, the
first step should be to rerun the function with \code{debug=1},
to see if the output suggests a problem in the call.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{\linkS4class{argoFloats}} with type=\code{"profiles"}, the
\code{data} slot of which contains two items: \code{url},
which holds the URLs from which the netcdf
files were downloaded, and \code{file}, which
holds the path names of the downloaded files; the latter
is used by \code{\link[=readProfiles]{readProfiles()}}.
}
\description{
This takes an index constructed with \code{\link[=getIndex]{getIndex()}}, possibly
after focusing with \code{\link[=subset,argoFloats-method]{subset,argoFloats-method()}}, and creates
a list of files to download from the server named in the index.
Then these files are downloaded to the \code{destdir} directory,
using filenames inferred from the source filenames. The
value returned by \code{\link[=getProfiles]{getProfiles()}} is suitable for use
by \code{\link[=readProfiles]{readProfiles()}}.
}
\details{
It should be noted that the constructed server URL follows
a different pattern on the usgodae an ifremer servers, and
so if some other server is used, the URL may be wrong, leading
to an error.  Similarly, if the patterns on these two
servers change, then \code{\link[=getProfiles]{getProfiles()}} will fail. Users who
encounter such problems are requested to report them
to the authors.

If a particular data file cannot be downloaded after multiple trials, then
the behaviour depends on the value of the \code{skip} argument.  If that is
\code{TRUE} then a \code{NA} value is inserted in the corresponding
spot in the return value, but if it is \code{FALSE} (the default), then an error is reported.
Note that \code{\link[=readProfiles]{readProfiles()}} skips over any such \code{NA} entries,
while reporting their positions within \code{index}.
