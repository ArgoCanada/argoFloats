\title{Switch unadjusted and adjusted data}
\usage{
useAdjusted(argo, debug = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{argo}{An \code{\linkS4class{argoFloats}} object, as read by \code{\link[=readProfiles]{readProfiles()}}.}

\item{debug}{An integer that, if positive, indicates that some debugging information
should be printed.}
}
\description{
Variables with original names indicating in the string \verb{_ADJUSTED} are
assigned nicknams names ending in \code{Adjusted} by \code{\link[=readProfiles]{readProfiles()}}, so that
e.g. \code{DOXY_ADJUSTED} gets the nickname \code{oxygenAdjusted}, while
\code{DOXY} gets the nickname \code{oxygen}. \code{useAdjusted} switches
these, renaming the adjusted values, so that e.g. \code{DOXY_ADJUSTED}
gets nickname \code{oxygen} and \code{DOXY} gets nickname \code{oxygenUnadjusted}.
This is carried out for all data families, and also for the
corresponding units and quality-control flags.  See \dQuote{Examples}
for an example using the \link{SD5903586_001.nc} sample dataset.

\details{
The adjustment process is complicated, and, since it was developed by
a combination of file inspection, a study of documentation, and discussions
with argo analysts, it is somewhat ad-hoc and may be changed later.
For this reason, users are advised strongly to examine their data files
closely, before blindly calling \code{useAdjusted}. The procedure is as follows.

There are two cases, depending on whether an item named \code{PARAMETER_DATA_MODE}
is present in the metadata stored in the netcdf file.
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Case 1.} If the \code{PARAMETER_DATA_MODE} field is present, then the
data columns are mapped to the parameter columns, and the following actions
are undertaken.
\itemize{
\item If \code{PARAMETER_DATA_MODE} is \code{"A"} (meaning "Adjusted") then use the
\verb{<PARAM>_ADJUSTED} values, \emph{unless} those values are all \code{NA}, in which case the
raw values are used instead. This is to account for the convention described in
Section 2.6.5 of Carval et al. (2019).
\item If \code{PARAMETER_DATA_MODE} is \code{"D"} (meaning "Delayed"), then proceed as for
the \code{"A"} case.
\item If \code{PARAMETER_DATA_MODE} is \code{"R"} (meaning "Realtime") then use the raw
values, even if the file contains data with \verb{<PARAM>_ADJUSTED} (e.g.
\code{"TEMP_ADJUSTED"}, which is the name used in netcdf files for the adjusted
temperature) in their names.
}
\item \strong{Case 2.} If no \code{PARAMETER_DATA_MODE} field is present, but \code{DATA_MODE}
is present, then the latter is used.  This does not apply to individual columns,
so the action depends on the data within the columns.
\itemize{
\item If \code{DATA_MODE} is \code{"A"} (meaning "Adjusted") then each data type is
considered in turn, and if the \verb{<PARAM>_ADJUSTED} values are \emph{all} \code{NA}
then the raw data are used, but if any of the \verb{<PARAM>_ADJUSTED} values
are not \code{NA}, then \emph{all} the \verb{<PARAM>_ADJUSTED} data are used.
\item If \code{DATA_MODE} is \code{"D"} (meaning "Delayed") then proceed as for
the \code{"A"} case.
\item If \code{DATA_MODE} is \code{"R"} then then use the raw values, even if the file
contains data with \verb{<PARAM>_ADJUSTED} in their names.
}
\item \strong{Case 3.} If neither \code{DATA_MODE} nor \code{PARAMETER_DATA_MODE} is present
in the metadata (a situation the developers have not encountered, but
which is included for completeness) then if \verb{<PARAM>_ADJUSTED} fields
are present, then they are handled as in the first and second items in
Case 2 above.

\section{Developer notes (may be removed at any time)}{


A study of a large set of realtime-mode and delayed-mode datasets
suggests that the \verb{_ADJUSTED} fields of the former consist only of \code{NA}
values, so that \code{useAdjusted} should only be used on delayed-mode
datasets. Users are cautioned that \code{useAdjusted} may
changed during the summer of 2020, to detect the mode and perhaps
refuse to exchange the data, if doing so would prevent wiping
out unadjusted data by replacing them with \code{NA} values.
