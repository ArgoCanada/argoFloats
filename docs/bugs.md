Please report any bugs, or suggests for improvements, at the [argoFloats
development site](http://github.com/dankelley/argoFloats/issues). If you are
good at R programming and know of a website that provides data that you think
might be of general interest, you may want to try writing some code to
contribute to `argoFloats`.  The simplest method would be to clone and generate
a git pull request. Please use one of the existing R files, such as `R/woa`, as
a guide, so that your suggested function will be similar to the existing ones.
This project uses the Roxygen system for documentation and the function
namespace, so please continue that pattern.
