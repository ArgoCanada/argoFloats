#' @param skip A logical value indicating whether to skip over netcdf
#' files that cannot be downloaded from the server.  This is `TRUE` by
#' default, to allow [getProfiles()] to handle out-of-date indices
#' without stopping when it tries to download netcdf files that are no
#' longer available.
