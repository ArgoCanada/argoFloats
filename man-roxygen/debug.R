#' @param debug integer value indicating level of debugging. If this
#' is less than 1, no debugging is done. Otherwise, some functions
#' will print debugging information.  If a function call fails, the
#' first step should be to rerun the function with `debug=1`,
#' to see if the output suggests a problem in the call.
